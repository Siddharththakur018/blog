                    Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can
                    share knowledge and wisdom with the world—without having to build
                    a mailing list or a following first. The internet is noisy and
                    chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple,
                    beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right readers for
                    whatever you have to say. Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our
                    collective understanding of the world through the power of
                    writing. We believe that what you read and write matters. Words
                    can divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world
                    where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win,
                    we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well
                    spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than drive-by
                    takes, and substance over packaging. Over 100 million people
                    connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. They’re
                    software developers, amateur novelists, product designers, CEOs,
                    and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the
                    world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping
                    them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve
                    learned that the rest of us might want to know too. Instead of
                    selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing
                    community of over a million Medium members who believe in our
                    mission. If you’re new here, start reading. Dive deeper into
                    whatever matters to you. Find a post that helps you learn
                    something new, or reconsider something familiar—and then write
                    your story.
